# Sand Chimes #

This is a very simple python script that randomly plays one of 4 bell chime sounds featured in the first pathologic game by Ice-Pick Lodge on set intervals, like the original game, the bells are a psychological gameplay element that keeps the player on edge by chiming once at the end of every hour. which is a constant stress throughout the 11 in-game days. 

This script makes your daily work shift a pathologic experience by using that same stressing factor to remind you of the passage of time, to gaslight yourself into being productive, there's no better way than to equate it with your unconscious desire to keep walkling and checking your mail that you've surely developed after playing that game.

## Usage ##

executing chimes.pyw runs it in the background through pythonw.exe, drag a .lnk into your startup directory if you'd like
